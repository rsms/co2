<p>Resource ownership rules in Co are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage locations own their data.</li>
<li>Ownership is transferred only for heap arrays. All other values are copied.</li>
<li>References are pointers to data owned by someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a storage location goes out of scope it relinquishes its ownership by bing &quot;dropped&quot;.
When a value is dropped, any heap arrays are deallocated.
Any lingering references to a dropped value are invalid.
Accessing such a reference causes a &quot;safe crash&quot; by panicing in &quot;safe&quot; builds
and has undefined behavior in &quot;fast&quot; builds.</p>
<p>A &quot;storage location&quot; is a variable, struct field, tuple element,
array element or function parameter.</p>
<p>All data is passed by value in Co.
Note that references are memory addresses (an integer) and thus technically
copied when passed around.</p>
